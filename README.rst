PAM System
====================

Pam system (Patent approximation matches system) is a textual analysis tool for matching legal type entities with its patent portfolio, for pairing entities the Pam system rely on the company name and combines full text search techniques using elasticsearch with some of the most famous approximate string matching algorithms such as Jaro-Winkler, Levensthein and Ratcliff. Moreover, it use each score for calculating its own pam score in order to select the best candidates and dismiss the wrong ones. Some interesting features are:

- Cleaning system for harmonizing company names (Stripping away organization suffix, removing stop words, using stemming words and synonyms).
- Highly modular so it can be easily extended.
- Use of a configuration language to facilitate the implementation of custom filters on the selector module.
- Opportunistic method since takes as a ccurate some low score matches just based on results.
- A command-line interface for parameterizing  the system.
- 100% Foss using GPLv3 License.


Quick start
-------------

To run Pam System you can use `venv <https://pip.pypa.io>`_::

    $ python3 -m venve pam_env
    $ source pam_env/bin/active

Now, you can install all the dependencies using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ and downloading some required `nltk data <https://www.nltk.org/data.html>`_ ::

    (pam_env)$ pip install -r requeriments.txt
    (pam_env)$ python setup.py install
    (pam_env)$ python -m nltk.downloader all

Finally you can run Pam using the csv file that contains entity list that you want to match::

    (pam_env)$ python -m pam --csv data/loads/you_company_list_file.csv
